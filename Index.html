    <h1>A little introduction to the site.</h1>
  <p>Hi, welcome to my website. This page will let you look through multiple lists describing many things that I like,
ranging from music artist and albums to  movies, and the marching band. I will also have links to sites that can
give you reviews and summarys of the books/movies if you have never watched or heard of them. I will also be providing links
to other pages on my own site like an about me page or means of contacting me.</p>
