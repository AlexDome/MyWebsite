  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>Hi, my name is Alex Dakota Dome-Hernandez. I was born and raised in Youngstown Ohio. If your know the place
then you know it's not exactly the nicest place and that it is not a place for the wealthy at all, but It's still a great place place
with amazing people.
    I moved into the school district at the beginning of 5th grade and I have been here ever since. I don't really
have any hobbies per say but I do love to skateboard and I love making music on my computer with my keyboard
and my drumpad. I have also started to post all music on youtube and soundcloud.
    I have also been on many basketball teams but for the past 3 years I have kind of stopped playing on a
team and have just been playing for fun.
    I just started coding this year and I have never actually wrote code until now. To be honest
when I signed up for Web Design I actually believed that it was graphics design and I was a little
confused when we started writing code instead of making squares and shapes inside of Adobe Illustrator.
