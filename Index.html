    <h1>A little introduction to the site.</h1>
   <p>Hi, welcome to my website. This page will let you look through multiple lists describing many things that I like,
ranging from books, movies, hobbies, and the classes that I take for this semester. I will also have links to sites that can
give you reviews and summarys of the books/movies if you have never watched or heard of them. I will also be providing links
to other pages on my own site like an about me page or means of contacting me.</p>

    <h3>My Classes
   <p>Here is the first of many lists that can help you get a better idea of me and in this case, the classes I will be taking
during the first half or semester of this school year.</p>
