    <h1>A little introduction to the site.</h1>
  <p>Hi, welcome to my website. This page will let you look through multiple lists describing many things that I like,
ranging from music artist and albums to  movies, and the marching band. I will also have links to sites that can
give you reviews and summarys of the books/movies if you have never watched or heard of them. I will also be providing links
to other pages on my own site as well.

then you know it's not exactly the nicest place and that it is not a place for the wealthy at all, but It's still a great place place
with amazing people.
