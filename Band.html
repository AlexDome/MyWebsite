    <p>As obvious as it is, you can probaly guess that I love everything about music.
I have an entire list of albums and singles on my music page but that's not even all of
my favorites. I have dozens of vinyls on my shelf but that's not what I am here to talk about.
Although I don't listen to classical music I love band class and being in the schools marching band.
On this page I won't really speak of the concert band but I will focus more on the marching band
and the things we do to help others get a better understanding of us and our challenges.

  <p>The Licking Heights Marching Band is like most high school bands, we don't really have an audition
and we don't compete on national or even global levels. We do have requirements though.
Learning how to play your part is completely indiviual work and you also must memorize all of your music, and
marching the show can take weeks to master. Everyday we have practice from 3-5.
