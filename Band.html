  <p>As obvious as it is, you can probaly guess that I love everything about music.
I have an entire list of albums and singles on my music page but that's not even all of
my favorites. I have dozens of vinyls on my shelf but that's not what I am here to talk about.
Although I don't listen to classical music I love band class and being in the schools marching band.
On this page I won't really speak of the concert band but I will focus more on the marching band
and the things we do to help others get a better understanding of us and our challenges.

  <p>The Licking Heights Marching Band is like most high school bands, we don't really have an audition
and we don't compete on national or even global levels. We do have requirements though.
Learning how to play your part is completely indiviual work and you also must memorize all of your music, and
marching the show can take weeks to master. Everyday we have practice from 3-5. We also perform every friday at <thead>
home and away football games.
  Almost every or every other saturday we perform at a OMEA band
competition where we are given scores and trophies. Last year (2017) when we marched our show
"Unbreakable" at our first competition we won 1st place in class A, Best Percussion, Best Overall
percussion, Best Auxillary, Best General Effect, Best solo, and we also won the Grand Champion award, we later
won the Grand Champion title for a second time at another competition.</p>

  <p>Most people see marching band as a very millitary and proper group to be in.
Although the discipline you must have can be very important our band is very playful.
You can always hear us cheering and having fun at football games and we always are telling jokes
during practice that even our director will sometimes join in on. For instance, last year
during band camp my friend and I had put sticky notes all over our teachers car during the lunch break.
However this may change depending on the band you join, some bands can be very strict and very disciplined
going to the point where they may even kick you off the field. These bands are normally double A or triple A
classed bands that have over 200 members.</p>
