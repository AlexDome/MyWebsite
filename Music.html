    <p>Here is my music page. It is basically a long list of albums and artists I like to listen to, there is a smaller list of my favortie songs
but I listen to hundreds of different songs everyday. To list every song and album I like would actually take years so here is an abridged version
of my musical taste.
  Also the generes I listen to mostly consits of Hip-Hop and some other smaller portions of mixed genres. However my music that is rap is multi
generational as I have music ranging from the 90's to 2018. So, here it is.</p>
