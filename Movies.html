    <p>Hello, as you may already know by now this page is dedicated to my large
and vast array of films that I absoulutly love and adore. The list is long but is no
actual order meaning that I like (most) of these movies "equally", however there
are some I like more than others.
<hr>
    <ul>
      <li>Ocean's 11, 12, and 13</li>
      <li>The Big Lebowski</li>
		<li>Super Troopers 1 and 2</li>
      <li>Spiderman 1 and 2                    </li>
      <li>Tag</li>
      <li>Major League</li>
		<li>Fast, and the Furious 1, 2,and 5</li>
      <li>Harold and Kumar escape Guantanamo Bay</li>
      <li>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</li>
		<li>John Wick 1 and 2</li>
      <li>Almost all of the Marvel movies, excluding a few.</li>
      <li>Meet the Blacks</li>
      <li>Lord of the Rings</li>
      <li>The Harry Potter series</li>
      <li>Men in Black</li>
      <li>Super Bad</li>
      <li>8 Mile</li>
      <li>Happy Gilmore</li>
      <li>Baby Driver (My most favortie)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So there they are, however if we talked in person I could most likely name
dozens maybe even hundreds of more movies I like. However due to me not being able to think
of enough or list ALL of them there is a smaller list of movies that I enjoy. If I where
to write out all of them I would need about three more websites to do that.</p>
